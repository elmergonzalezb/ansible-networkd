# .. envvar:: networkd_interface_weight_map
#
# Configuration of network interfaces is read executed in alphabetical order.
# Because of that, order of different interface types is significant. This
# dictionary provides a mapping between various interface types and a "weight"
# value which will be prepended to the interface filename to create correct order
# of network interfaces.
#
# You can override the default weight by specifying ``item.weight`` key in
# interface configuration.
